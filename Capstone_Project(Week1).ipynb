Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an **Recreational multi-sport arena** in **Toronto**, Canada.\n\nSince there is a population boom in toronto and recreational play is preferred by people of all ages,  we will try to detect **locations that do not have many indoor sports arenas**. We are also particularly interested in **areas with no gyms in vicinity**. We would also prefer locations **as close to populous centers like Downtown toronto as possible**, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n\nWe will use our data science analysis to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."
